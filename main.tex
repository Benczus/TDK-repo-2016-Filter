I,
Bence Bogd√°ndy
,
declare
that
this
thesis
titled,
'Comparison of WiFi RSSI Filtering Methods'
and
the
work
presented
in
it
are
my
own.
I
confirm
that:


This
work
was
done
wholly
or
mainly
while
in
candidature
for
a
research
degree
at
this
University.



Where
any
part
of
this
thesis
has
previously
been
submitted
for
a
degree
or
any
other
qualification
at
this
University
or
any
other
institution,
this
has
been
clearly
stated.


Where
I
have
consulted
the
published
work
of
others,
this
is
always
clearly
attributed.


Where
I
have
quoted
from
the
work
of
others,
the
source
is
always
given.
With
the
exception
of
such
quotations,
this
thesis
is
entirely
my
own
work.


I
have
acknowledged
all
main
sources
of
help.


Where
the
thesis
is
based
on
work
done
by
myself
jointly
with
others,
I
have
made
clear
exactly
what
was
done
by
others
and
what
I
have
contributed
myself
