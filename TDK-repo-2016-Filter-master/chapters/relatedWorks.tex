\section{Indoor Positiong}
GPS is a very popular method of position, however it is not suited for indoor envirments.
Indoor Positioning Systems use several techniques to acquire location based data.
These methods include Wireless LAN, Bluetooth connectivity, and several other infrared, rf and ultrasonic signals to describe a location.

\subsection{Indoor Positioning with Wireless LAN}
While Wireless LAN(WLAN) was designed to transmit data wirelessly over small distances, in most cases, connecting to the internet, it proves to be an effective way to determine indoor locations. WLAN is highly available since most devices can receive and process WLAN signals, which proves the most inexpensive and easiest way to implement filters on. It also proves to be cost-effective since the data received is highly accurate in most situations. Signal Strenght is measured and sent by either the Access Point, or the user.
