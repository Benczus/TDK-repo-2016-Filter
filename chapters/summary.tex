The research surrounding the active filtering of data sets is a very popular topic today, and for a good reason.
This paper proves that preprocessing filters can be a very effective tool in indoor positioning research and generally increasing WLAN signals.
Even using using a simple, time windowing program can increase signal strength and accuracy by a margin, which proves that implementing more filters could result in an optimal method.
